# ZumoMazeBot

Achivements

-I have managed to complete task 1 throught 6 but i could not quite get question 7 completed.
-I managed to overcome task one by using a c# form using key presses to write to my port, thus sending them to the aurdino
-I comoleted task 2, 3 and 4 by using the line sensors (1 , 3 , 5) as that allowed me to gain a good view on what was infront of the robot and what was either side, inorperating this with autonomous control.
-I completed task 5 with the proximity sensors detecting anything in the rooms, and using a pre selected movement for searchjing each room, using the turn angles for a complete search of each room. These room are seached and if an object if found within, that room gets marked down as being occupied in my GUI.
-I completed task 6 with my turning algorithm once again, but i could not get the full automonous retarcing of steps as i was having some issues with my variables.
-I could not fully attemp tas 7 as i had limitations with my retracing abailities of my robot.


-I used some code from different outside sources for help with the gyroscope calibration. I adapted these in my own work to incoperate them into a working turing algorith for my robot. These included the turnSensor.cpp and turnSensor.h files.
